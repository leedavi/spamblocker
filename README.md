# spamblocker
The SpamBlocker program creates a regexpr list of spam sites and updates the IIS applicationHost.config file with a url rewrite rule.


THE URLREWRITER MODULE MUST BE INSTALLED ON IIS FOR THIS TO WORK

the spamblocker.exe can take 1 argument, which is the url of the list of url sources to build the list with.

e.g.

spamblocker.exe http://params.nevoweb.com/spam-blacklist-sources.txt

If no parameter is passed the a default of "http://params.nevoweb.com/spam-blacklist-sources.txt" will be used.

The url source list should be a simple txt list of sources that spamblocker will use.

e.g.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piwik/referrer-spam-blacklist/master/spammers.txt

http://params.nevoweb.com/spam-blacklist.txt


The first of the examples is the piwik github list.

The second is the nevoweb spam sites we have noticed, these 2 lists should be a simple text file, with each line being a spam url.

e.g.

traffic2cash.xyz
site-48089558-1.snip.tw
top1-seo-service.com
quit-smoking.ga
santasgift.ml
build-a-better-business.2your.site
topseoservices.co
trafficgenius.xyz
build-audience.for-your.website
new-look.for-your.website
rusexy.xyz
w3javascript.com
smarter-content.for-your.website
website-stealer-warning.hdmoviecamera.net
 
Each url on the source list will be read and then used to build the regexpr.

This program can be ran from the windows task scheduler.  Usually setup to run on the 1st of everymonth month.  But can be set to run each night is wanted.  The IIS rule will only be updated if the source urls for spam change.
